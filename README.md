# Gift lab
This is a lab that allows me to explore making vulnerable labs as part of my Web AppSec Journey.
## Purpose
The purpose of the app is that a user can create lists for gift ideas. Those gift lists then can be shared with other users.
## Installation
To run the lab simply run `nmp install`, after the node_modules have been installed, you can run the app with `node server.js`
## How to use it
- If you want to learn black box testing, run the app and hack away.
- Should you want to do code review, all code is available :)
## Remarks
- Please note that the database is in memory, so all data is lost after the application has been closed.
- This is a work in progress, noise in the responses, unintended vulns are part of my journey and I promise to make it as good as possible.
- You are free to use, edit this application as you wish.
